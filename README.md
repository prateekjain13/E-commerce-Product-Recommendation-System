# Ecommerce Product Recommendation System â€“ Cold Start Problem Solution

## Overview
This project builds an Ecommerce product recommendation system aimed at solving the **cold start problem**, a common challenge in recommender systems where new users or items lack sufficient interaction data. The system addresses both **user** and **item cold start** issues by leveraging rank-based recommendations for new users and content-based filtering for new items. Additionally, a hybrid approach is used to enhance recommendation accuracy, combining collaborative filtering with content-based methods to provide tailored product suggestions.

## Key Features
- Rank-based recommendations for new users.
- Content-based filtering for new items.
- Hybrid approach for enhanced accuracy.
